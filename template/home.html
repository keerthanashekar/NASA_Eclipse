        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium; text-align: justify;">Eclipses also appear in religious texts. Christian texts mention that the Moon turned to blood after Jesus's crucifixion - potentially referring to a lunar eclipse, during which the Moon takes on a reddish hue. Using this textual source, scholars narrowed down a possible date of crucifixion to Friday, April 3, 33 C.E. because a lunar eclipse occurred that day. In the Quran, a solar eclipse is mentioned before the birth of Mohammed as well as on the day his son, Ibrahim, passed.If Earth were rotating at the same speed it is now, these eclipses would have occurred thousands of miles from Anyang. Since we know they occurred in Anyang, the scientists concluded that Earth's rotation had slowed by 47-thousandths of a second per day in the past 3,200 years.</p>

          <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium; text-align: justify;">Eclipses, those captivating celestial phenomena, have stirred the imaginations of diverse cultures across time, weaving a rich tapestry of myths and beliefs. These interpretations run the gamut: from ancient China's dragon that devours sun or moon, met with cacophonous rituals, to Greece's view of eclipses as ominous signals from the gods. Hinduism attributes eclipses to the demon Rahu, while Navajo Nation sees them as potent and potentially harmful events necessitating special ceremonies. For the Maya, eclipses hold profound cosmic significance, leading to elaborate rituals. In ancient Egypt, the god Set, harbinger of chaos, often bore the blame for unsettling eclipses. Korean mythology introduces fire dogs attempting to steal the sun, countered by loud noises and arrows. In Norse mythology, Fenrir, a wolf-like entity, heralds Ragnarok with the sun's devouring during eclipses, a harbinger of impending doom. These myths exemplify the myriad ways in which cultures have endeavored to explain and engage with eclipses, underscoring the enduring connection between celestial events and human culture throughout history.</p><br>
