Eclipses: Perspective is Everything

Project Description

We have developed a solution to address the questions mentioned above. Additionally, we have created a simulation that demonstrates the type of eclipse that occurs at a specific point when the Earth and Moon are positioned on their solar orbits. Our project includes two interactive activities:

Eclipse Type Prediction: Given specific angles and positions, our tool predicts the type of eclipse (solar or lunar) that will occur.

Eclipse Simulation: Our simulation allows users to visualize both solar and lunar eclipses in a realistic and educational manner.
